# Object Detection on CPU on Android

Please see [Hello World! in MediaPipe on Android](hello_world_android.md) for
general instructions to develop an Android application that uses MediaPipe. This
doc focuses on the
[example graph](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/graphs/object_detection/object_detection_android_cpu.pbtxt)
that performs object detection with TensorFlow Lite on CPU.

This is very similar to the
[Object Detection on GPU on Android](object_detection_android_gpu.md) example
except that at the beginning and the end of the graph it performs GPU-to-CPU and
CPU-to-GPU image transfer respectively. As a result, the rest of graph, which
shares the same configuration as the
[GPU graph](images/mobile/object_detection_android_gpu.png), runs entirely on
CPU.

## App

The graph is used in the
[Object Detection CPU](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/tree/master/mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/objectdetectioncpu)
example app. To build the app, run:

```bash
bazel build -c opt --config=android_arm64 mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/objectdetectioncpu
```

To further install the app on android device, run:

```bash
adb install bazel-bin/mediapipe/examples/android/src/java/com/google/mediapipe/apps/objectdetectioncpu/objectdetectioncpu.apk
```

## Graph

To visualize the graph as shown above, copy the text specification of the graph
below and paste it into [MediaPipe Visualizer](https://viz.mediapipe.dev/).

# Images on GPU coming into and out of the graph.

# Transfers the input image from GPU to CPU memory for the purpose of
# demonstrating a CPU-based pipeline. Note that the input image on GPU has the
# origin defined at the bottom-left corner (OpenGL convention). As a result,
# the transferred image on CPU also shares the same representation.

# Throttles the images flowing downstream for flow control. It passes through
# the very first incoming image unaltered, and waits for
# TfLiteTensorsToDetectionsCalculator downstream in the graph to finish
# generating the corresponding detections before it passes through another
# image. All images that come in while waiting are dropped, limiting the number
# of in-flight images between this calculator and
# TfLiteTensorsToDetectionsCalculator to 1. This prevents the nodes in between
# from queuing up incoming images and data excessively, which leads to increased
# latency and memory usage, unwanted in real-time mobile applications. It also
# eliminates unnecessarily computation, e.g., a transformed image produced by
# ImageTransformationCalculator may get dropped downstream if the subsequent
# TfLiteConverterCalculator or TfLiteInferenceCalculator is still busy
# processing previous inputs.
